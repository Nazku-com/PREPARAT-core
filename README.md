# PREPARAT-core

**PREPARAT-core** is an API wrapper Written in swift that designed to simplify the development of clients for ActivityPub-based platforms like Mastodon and Misskey. 
By wrapping the APIs of these platforms into a unified endpoint, PREPARAT-core provides developers with a single interface for interacting with multiple implementations of ActivityPub. 
This reduces complexity and helps streamline the integration process for client applications.

## Status

This project is currently in the **Proof of Concept (POC)** phase, with only basic functionality implemented.
